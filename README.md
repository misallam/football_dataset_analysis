# Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is from FIFA and contains detailed attributes of players, such as their skills, value, reputation, and more. During the exploration phase, we read the data, understand its structure, and provide basic descriptive statistics.

# Preprocessing
Data is rarely perfect. In our preprocessing section, we handle missing values by filling them with appropriate replacements like mean values or mode values, ensuring our dataset is cleaner and more consistent.
